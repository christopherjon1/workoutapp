This app is made for those that are curious to keep track of their workouts and get a good view on their improvements. This is done by giving the user a way to see past workouts as well as charts of all their workouts. The app is made for Iphones, works best for 6 but works with other types. The rotation is disabled, although it would work if it wasn't it looks much better if you can't. The blue icons on the main page show how much work you did this week compared to the previous work. (the ? shows what this means) A great workout is a filled icon (more weight pushed for that body part compared to the previous week) a good work out is dotted (body part worked but not as much work as the previous week) Nothing worked out will be an empty icon. You can add a new workout new exercises or choose exixting. Add sets to exercises, time your break in between your sets as well. When done you can add notes, finish and see the overview. Cardio is done by clicking on the heart on the main page. You can also select an old workout from the main page above the start new workout. The bottom has a nav bar where you can go home, to past workouts (ordered by newest workout, when clicked on you can see the overview again), the stats (which you can choose a body part to see all past workouts total weight pushed), and the settings.
